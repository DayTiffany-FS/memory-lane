A single-page application is presented to the user through a single web page and is designed to be more responsive like a regular desktop application. Information on the app changes as the user inputs different things. Due to their nature of changing so dynamically, they are ideal for all types devices. Popular examples include Gmail, Twitter, Netflix, and Facebook.

An SPA involves a client and a web server, like non-SPA's. But unlike non-SPA's, after the initial GET request, the client-server interactions change the webpage. Due to the nature of the way they load and manipulate content, SPA's load faster which improves the user experience. The separation of back-end from front-end requires less development time and effort because the teams can work independently and only collaborate when necessary.

Some of the disadvantages include a substantial coding effort. Search engine optimization can also be diffult which makes the it more difficult for users to find by searching the web. Depending on whether secure coding was used, security can be a concern which can lead to exposed user data. Inconsistent user experience is another potential problem across different devices.

Building SPA's is supported through many different development platforms, including Angular and React. This adds a different dynamic for upcoming developers to think about when starting new projects or working on existing projects of this nature.
