My name is Tiffany. I am a student at Full Sail University working towards my Bachelor's degree in Web Development. It is my goal to one day be self employed so that I can be my own boss. Outside of beign a student, I am a wife, a mother, a gamer, an OCD kitchen cleaner, an avid music lover, and an all around bum. I have one cat currently and hope to up that number to 100 one day, when my husband isn't looking!
